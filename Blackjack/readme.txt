Hey gang, it's FireMonk from the Programming overdrive hood.
I've been learning Python vfor quite a while and I thought that it now is the hightime I start applying my knowledge into some projects.
This is my first project "#GAME"
I had a really good mentor to guide me in the making of the project.
But god swear I really started from scratch with just an idea of what to d in the game and was on it for hours before I completed it.
Mannnn!!!!!! The awesomeness I felt on completion was worth 1000 kgs of 24k gold XD.

Go ahead and enjoy but remember you need to download both "art.py" and "game_file.py" in the same directory.
Good luck! I've done my best to assure it's un-biased-ness and bug-free-ness.
Hope you enjoy it.
